  <h1>SourceLess Decentralized Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>These Terms apply to the use of the SourceLess decentralized ecosystem, interfaces, and related materials (the “Services”). By accessing the Services you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Ownership</h2>
  <p>All materials, trademarks, and identifiers are the exclusive property of Alexandru Marius Stratulat and the SourceLess team. “SourceLess” and associated marks are trademarks of their respective owners.</p>

  <h2>Non-Custodial & Decentralized</h2>
  <p>The Services are provided as non-custodial tools. You retain control of your keys and assets. No custody, control, or guarantee of value, performance, or availability is provided.</p>

  <h2>On-Chain / Off-Chain Interactions</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed on-chain (consensus, PoE commitments, ZK attestations) and off-chain (indexing, caching, UI state). Off-chain data is best-effort and not authoritative; on-chain records prevail in case of discrepancy.</p>

  <h2>Security & GodCypher</h2>
  <p>GodCypher and related cryptographic constructs are used to enhance confidentiality and integrity. No cryptographic system can provide absolute security. Use at your own risk and maintain best practices for key management.</p>

  <h2>Proof of Existence (PoE)</h2>
  <p>The system prioritizes PoE for auditability. Proofs may be batched and redacted publicly. Private proofs may include additional metadata subject to applicable privacy rules.</p>

  <h2>No Warranties</h2>
  <p>The Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind. You are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to misuse the Services, including attempting to circumvent security, disrupt networks, or engage in unlawful activity.</p>

  <h2>Updates</h2>
  <p>These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.</p>

  <p>For questions, contact the SourceLess team.</p>
