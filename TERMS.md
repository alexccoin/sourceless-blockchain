# SourceLess Decentralized Terms & Conditions

## 1. Scope
These Terms govern use of the SourceLess decentralized ecosystem, dashboards, scripts, and associated materials ("Services"). Access implies agreement.

## 2. Ownership
All materials are owned by Alexandru Marius Stratulat and the SourceLess Team. "SourceLess" and related marks are trademarks. No transfer of IP rights.

## 3. Non-Custodial Nature
You retain control of private keys and assets. The Services do not provide custody, guarantees of recovery, or financial advice.

## 4. On-Chain vs Off-Chain
On-chain records (ledger, PoE, consensus) are authoritative. Off-chain caches (metrics, UI states) are supplementary and may lag or differ. In case of discrepancy, on-chain data prevails.

## 5. GodCypher & Cryptography
GodCypher augments confidentiality and integrity. No cryptographic suite is absolute; employ best practices (secure key storage, updated clients).

## 6. Proof of Existence (PoE)
PoE is prioritized for auditability. Public views may redact identity metadata; private contexts may show extended domains and participants.

## 7. Acceptable Use
Do not attempt to disrupt networks, perform unauthorized access, or engage in unlawful activity. Abuse may trigger protective measures.

## 8. Disclaimers
Services are provided "AS IS" without warranties (express or implied). You assume all risks related to performance, availability, and usage.

## 9. Updates
Terms may evolve. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Review periodically.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, no liability for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use.

## 11. Governing Law
Subject to applicable international and local laws respecting decentralized technologies.

## 12. Contact
